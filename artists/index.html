				<h3>Anna Comella</h3>
				<p>Anna is a Boston-based artist inspired by urban, gritty environments and the artist communities around her. She has a studio in Boston's oldest artist community, Fort Point, as well as in Boston's South End, another mecca for artists. Belonging to both of these communities provides a rich environment of art and connection with fellow artists.</p>
				<p>Both areas have undergone enormous changes in the past 5-10 years and she uses these changes to inspire her work. She sees this reinvention as a way to challenge myself as an artist and to experiment with new ways of creating art.</p>
				<p>Anna was originally trained in printmaking but has experimented with metals, sculpture, jewelry making, collage, acrylic painting, encaustic, and recently with mosaic fabrication. No matter what the medium or size, her work is always comprised of layers of abstract images and colors. Her intent is for the viewer to find his or her own connection and meaning in the work.</p>

				<h3>Matt McKee</h3>
				<p>The Sweet Shrapnel Portfolio represents my own apprehension with our intersections of technology with natural systems. The series is not meant to be anti- or pro- anything.</p>
				<p>In my mind, it encompasses everything from genetic manipulations to cyber connectivity. Our impact on processes and evolutions that have been tested and processed over millennia are now being altered at a violent pace.</p>
				<p>And, our solutions to the problems that we are solving immediately will ultimately have an impact that will be felt far into the future.</p>
				<p>Yet, violent change is not new and is a part of the galactic system.</p>
				<p>The question, and my apprehension, is whether we will feel the impact now or in 10 years. What will exist to feel the impact in 1000 years?</p>

				<h3>Tori ellen Roy</h3>
				<p>Tori's work encompasses her family and home over the past two years. Her story takes place in the borough of Fabyan, which is a small community within the larger farming town of Thompson, Connecticut. She began photographing here to gain a better understanding of who my family was and the significance of this place that has remained at the center of her world. The process of making images evolved into a more intimate and internalized exploration when my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer a year later. During this time, she watched her family transition through the shifts and waves of emotions observing both distance and estrangement as well as closeness and vulnerability.</p>

				<h3>Daniel Roy</h3>
				<p>This series of paintings are inspired by his trips to the Irish Country Side, specifically the Galway area and the western part of Ireland. The blue sheep theme was developed by taking photographic images of roaming bands of sheep spread out in areas with little human inhabitants. The spray paint markings used by the owner to track the sheep, especially the blue paint, was very surrealistic and inspired the sheep series. The Red Sky paintings are a reflection of the contrast in the landscape forms found in the northwest area which are quite different from the green landscapes found in other areas in Ireland. Also included are landform paintings taken from local areas and wetlands in Northeastern Connecticut.</p>
