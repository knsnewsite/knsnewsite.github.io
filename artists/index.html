				<h3>Tori ellen Roy</h3>
				<p>Tori's work encompasses her family and home over the past two years. Her story takes place in the borough of Fabyan, which is a small community within the larger farming town of Thompson, Connecticut. She began photographing here to gain a better understanding of who my family was and the significance of this place that has remained at the center of her world. The process of making images evolved into a more intimate and internalized exploration when my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer a year later. During this time, she watched her family transition through the shifts and waves of emotions observing both distance and estrangement as well as closeness and vulnerability.</p>

				<h3>Daniel Roy</h3>
				<p>This series of paintings are inspired by his trips to the Irish Country Side, specifically the Galway area and the western part of Ireland. The blue sheep theme was developed by taking photographic images of roaming bands of sheep spread out in areas with little human inhabitants. The spray paint markings used by the owner to track the sheep, especially the blue paint, was very surrealistic and inspired the sheep series. The Red Sky paintings are a reflection of the contrast in the landscape forms found in the northwest area which are quite different from the green landscapes found in other areas in Ireland. Also included are landform paintings taken from local areas and wetlands in Northeastern Connecticut.</p>
