			<p>Dana started out with an education in the arts. He had  been involved in the creative world of hair early on during his exploits in the music industry with bands and music types since he was a teenager. Finally, after a colorful and varied work history, Dana dove head first into his new passion for hair and fashion.</p>

			<p>Over the last five years he built quite a reputation for himself at Liquid Hair Studios. During that time Dana became a color educator for Joico. He is also certified with Beth Minardi Signature, Redkin, Matrix/ Logics, Kevin Murphy, Global Keratin and Brazilian Blowout while also taking numerous styling/cutting classes and seeking out education to always further himself.</p>

			<p>Dana has built up a diverse clientele that covers the every day styling of short hair, long hair, curly hair, the avant-garde and everything else in between for both men and women.</p>
