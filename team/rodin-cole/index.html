					<p>Enormously friendly, charismatic and eloquent, Rodin has been in the business of making gorgeous for over 20 years.</p>

					<p>When asked if he thinks that having been dressing hair since 1990 gives him any  advantage over any of the younger talent, he says “It’s been my experience that fashion is cyclical.  Each trend makes its way back into the lime light.  If you understand it’s origins, you have the unique ability to deliver that style with a new sensibility.  I’ve had the pleasure of being in the industry long enough to have had a number of greats looks revisited.  Please come and let me help you find what you’re looking for.”</p>
