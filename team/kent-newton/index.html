<p>Kent Newton has been in the hair industry for over sixteen years. Prior to opening his own salon Kent served as a senior stylist, salon manager and education director at two of Boston’s finest Newbury Street salons – James Joseph Salon and Salon Mario Russo.</p>

<p>Kent seeks to style hair so as to enhance the natural beauty of each client of any age. As has been said of his work: “Neither overly trendy nor ultraconservative, Newton makes sure his clients leave his chair pleased with their polished and pretty manes.”</p>

<p>Kent has trained with Bumble and Bumble, Vidal Sassoon, The Doves, Toni and Guy and Orlando Pita.</p>

<p>A self professed “architectural junkie,” Newton believes that “a perfect haircut is the foundation of every great look.”</p>

<p>Working backstage, Kent has been a part of numerous fashion shows, including Chanel, St. John, John Varvatos and Tommy Hilfiger.</p>

<p>With a long and loyal client list including local and national celebrities, Newton, as W Magazine wrote, “…has styled his fair share of Beantown’s Elite.”</p>
