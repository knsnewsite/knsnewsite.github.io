<p>After completing a foundation year at The Art Institute of Boston Thom decided to pursue a career in cosmetology.  He started his journey assisting and studying at Vidal Sassoon for two years where he learned advanced cutting and styling techniques.</p>
<p>Thom went on to work at two of the most sought-after salons on Newbury Street, Sal Sanazarro and James Joseph Salon, styling hair for magazine photo shoots and fashion shows. In 2001, Thom was awarded Best Men's Hair Cut by the Improper Bostonian Magazine.</p>
<p>In 2002 Thom's pursuit of hair and his work as a fine artist landed him in New York City. He worked in various salons around Manhattan and Brooklyn.</p>
<p>Thom is now very excited and honored to be returning back to Boston to work once again with some of the best talents in the city.</p>
