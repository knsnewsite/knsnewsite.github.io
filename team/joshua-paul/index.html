<p>Joshua Paul understands that luxury is all about the details. He built a career in design working with high profile retailers as top display artist putting together compelling visual marketing and printed media. It is his passion and eye for detail that puts his clients at ease.</p>

<p>“I loved creating window visuals but they were static. Hair is dynamic and has incredible movement. I love seeing a client shift their hair and smile at themselves in the mirror when I am done.”</p>

<p>Education is an important part of a great career. Joshua’s formal training comes from Vidal Sassoon learning key concepts and the craft that has made Sassoon a household name. Joshua continues his education with other big names like Oribe, Aveda, Sebastian, Wella and Nioxin. Joshua believes in pushing the boundaries of hairdressing and delivering creativity, quality and consistency to every client</p>

<p>“I love incorporating the latest trends in hair and creating them into styles you can wear every day.”</p>
