Prior to joining the team at Kent Newton Salon in 2012, Lily worked at Giacomo Salon in Kenmore Square and in 1997 she joined the team at Mitchell John Salon. In 2002 she relocated to Scottsdale, Arizona until her return to Boston in 2011.</p>

<p>Lily was trained apprentice style by one of Boston’s top hairstylists Giacomo DiRado of Giacomo Salon in Kenmore Square. Over the years, Lily has also taken many master cutting classes in New York City from Bumble and Bumble in the art of razor cutting and private classes in hair coloring (apprentice style) from Gianluc who hails from Italy and has worked all over Europe. Lily has also received more private sessions with John Sahaag, a stylist from New York, who has had a major influence of Lily’s styling views.</p>

<p>Lily was one of the youngest members of Intercouriffer - an internationally recognized hairstyling group. With this connection Lily had the pleasure of meeting many of the world’s top stylists, taking classes with the group and participating in hair shows. Lily’s art was first published in a local fashion show in 1991 by Boston’s hip rag “The Improper Bostonian” and was also featured in Allure Magazine as one of Boston’s top colorists in the industry in 2000.</p>

<p>In 1997 along with Tabatha Coffey, Lily participated in Hair Color USA multiple times and was recognized for her innovative thinking, fresh color ideas and creative talent. Lily worked as an educator for Goldwell of New England for approximately six years where she participated and taught classes and shows all over New England. Lily’s creativity spilled over into the design of many coloring techniques for Goldwell of New England and she has been recognized by many publications that focus on the art of hair coloring.</p>

<p>In 2012, Lily received her second Master Colorist certificate from Wella USA and in 2013 she became Kent Newton’s Director of Color Education. Other certificates that Lily accrued are Brazilian Blow Out certified, Coppola Keratin Complex certified and is in the process of achieving her certification of balayage techniques from L’Oréal. Lily’s major focus is on hair color but does take pride in completing the whole design, with her focus on service and a level of professionalism that will speak for itself. She participated in many “Hair Cares” events throughout the city of Boston.</p>

<p>Lily believes that hair coloring is the amazing combination of artistry and chemistry that is extremely intriguing. “I take great pride in the art I create. I have extreme passion and love of designing hair and color to enhance the beauty of all that I have the pleasure to work on. If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good you can accomplish anything, the sky is the limit. Stay beautiful and you will stay happy.”</p>
