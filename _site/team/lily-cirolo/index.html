			<p>Lily has been working as a hairstylist/colorist for 23 years. She has been a Goldwell USA certified master-colorist for over 14 years.</p>

			<p>Prior to joining our team Lily worked at Giacomo Salon, as well as Mitchell John Salon.</p>

			<p>She was trained apprentice-style by one of Boston’s top hairstylists, Giacomo Dirado, of Giacomo Salon in Kenmore Square. Lily has also taken numerous cutting and styling classes from Bumble and Bumble (New York City) and is aproud to have served as apprentice to the renowned Italian colorist Gian Luc. She also credits her many private sessions with the late celebrity stylist John Sahag as a major influence on her styling views.</p>

			<p>Lily was one of the youngest members of Intercoiffure, “the most powerful and influential organization in the hair dressing industry.” As a member, she was able to meet many of the world’s top stylists, take classes from them and participate in hair shows.</p>

			<p>Her work was first published in 1991 by Boston’s hip lifestyle magazine, The Improper Bostonian. In 1999 she was also featured in Allure magazine for being one of Boston‘s top colorists.</p>

			<p>Lily has participated in Hair Color USA multiple times (where she worked along side of Tabatha Coffey in 1997) and has been recognized there for her innovative thinking, fresh color ideas and creative talent.</p>

			<p>Lily worked as a Goldwell/New England educator for 6 years and has taught and participated in classes and shows throughout New England and other locales such as Chicago and Miami.</p>

			<p>Lily’s major focus is on hair color (for which she has been acclaimed by many leading publications), but does take pride in completing the whole design. Her focus on service and level of professionalism speak for themselves.</p>

			<p>“I take great pride in the art that I create. I am passionate and love designing and coloring hair to enhance the beauty of each of my clients. To paraphrase the recently deceased Vidal Sassoon: ‘If you look good, you feel good.’ And, if you feel good you can accomplish anything. The sky’s the limit. Stay beautiful and you will stay happy.”</p>
